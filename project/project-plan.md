# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate impact on Crop production and Co2 emission

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. "How have climate variations influenced CO2 emissions and crop production trends at the national level in the United States between 1990 and 2015?"

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is a major problem because it affects our environment, weather patterns, ecosystems, and human society, leading to severe consequences such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, Co2 Emission.
This projects analyzes history data from 1990 and 2015, filter out the data for USA region. The results can give insights into how climate change impacted crop production and co2 emission. The result will give average crop production and Co2 emission value.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource 1: ExampleSource
* Metadata URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)
* Data URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-relationship-between-crop-production-and-cli)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides data on crop yields, harvested areas, and production quantities for wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans. Crop yields are the harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most cases yield data are not recorded but are obtained by dividing the production data by the data on the area harvested. The actual yield that is captured on a farm depends on several factors such as the crop's genetic potential, the amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients absorbed by the crop, the presence of weeds and pests. This indicator is presented for wheat, maize, rice, and soybean. Crop production is measured in tonnes per hectare.

### Datasource 2: ExampleSource
* Metadata URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country
* Data Type: CSV

The CO2 emissions dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the amount of CO2 emitted by each country. The dataset includes information on CO2 emissions by country from 1960 to the present day. It covers all countries in the world and is compiled from various sources, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).
