# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate impact on Crop production and Co2 emission

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. "How have climate variations influenced CO2 emissions and crop production trends at the national level in the United States between 1990 and 2015?"

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is a major problem because it affects our environment, weather patterns, ecosystems, and human society, leading to severe consequences such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise.
This projects analyzes history data from 1990 and 2015. The results can give insights into how climate change impacted crop production and co2 emission.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource 1: ExampleSource
* Metadata URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)
* Data URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-relationship-between-crop-production-and-cli)
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset has climate change indicators for different countries with their associated codes(ISO2 AND ISO3). The measurement has been updated yearly till 2022 from 1961.

### Datasource 2: ExampleSource
* Metadata URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv)
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides valuable insights into the ongoing changes in our climate. It encompasses a comprehensive collection of temperature records, CO2 emissions data, and sea level rise measurements. With a focus on global trends, it enables researchers, scientists, and climate enthusiasts to analyze the impact of climate change on our planet.
