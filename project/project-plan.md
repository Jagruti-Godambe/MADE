# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate change insights

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What insights have we gained about the evolution and impact of climate change from 1992 to 2022?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change is a major problem because it affects our environment, weather patterns, ecosystems, and human society, leading to severe consequences such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise.
This projects analyzes history data from 1992 and 2022. The results can give insights into how climate change impacted so many factors.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
