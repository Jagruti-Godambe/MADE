# Project Plan

## Title
Correlation analysis for Wildfire Data and Greenhouse Gas Emission

## Main Question

1. What is the relationship between wildfire occurrences and greenhouse gas emissions?
2. How do changes in wildfire activity impact climate change dynamics?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This data science project investigates the interplay between wildfires and greenhouse gas emissions, exploring their mutual influence on climate change dynamics. Analyzing wildfire and greenhouse gas datasets, the project aims to understand correlations between wildfire occurrences and emissions, and their broader impacts on atmospheric composition and climate patterns. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, it seeks to uncover insights to inform climate change mitigation strategies. By elucidating these complex interactions, the project contributes to our understanding of wildfire-climate relationships, facilitating the development of more effective measures for environmental sustainability and resilience against climate change impacts.
